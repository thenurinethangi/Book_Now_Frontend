# Synema – Movie Ticket Booking Platform (Frontend)

## Overview
**Synema** is a full-stack movie ticket booking platform designed to support multiple cinemas, multiple screens, and real-time seat-based bookings within a single system. The application focuses on providing a smooth and reliable booking experience for users while offering dedicated management interfaces for cinemas and system administrators.

This repository contains the **frontend application**, developed using **React and TypeScript**, with an emphasis on usability, performance, and responsive design across devices.

From a user perspective, Synema allows users to browse and search movies by title, genre, or cinema, view complete movie details (including trailers and cast information), and check showtimes for the same movie across different cinemas and screens. Users can also search by cinema to find nearby cinemas and view the movies currently playing at a selected cinema along with their available showtimes and ticket prices.
